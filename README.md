##  Reproducing Deep Learning or LLM Model

**Objective:** The primary goal of our project is to predict stock prices using news articles and social media posts. To accomplish this, we need to employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accurately assess sentiment scores from these sources. As a starting point, I implemented an LSTM model as a baseline to serve as both a foundation and a benchmark for evaluating the performance of our proposed model

## Dataset
I used the following dataset for training the model. Please check out the corresponding websites to explore more details about the datasets
